# About this Repository
This repository contains my final project (in collaboration with Joseph Doraid '23) for STAT 139: Introduction to Linear Models. This course was taken during my time as undergraduate student at Harvard during the Fall '22 semester. The project centers around investigating the statistical relationship between teams' on-court performance in the NBA and their future revenue when controlling for other factors.
